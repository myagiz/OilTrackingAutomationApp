# OilTrackingAutomationApp
Oil Tracking Automation DesktopApp (Petrol Ofis data used)

Hello guys, today I want to share a simple program that I made again. I made a tracking automation that we can use in oil companies. It was created in C # under windows form application. On top of that, a decisive progress on the oil in the company is in a structure where you can easily find the oil purchase and sales, company information and sample logo. I showed the oil type sales you made in a datagridview in order according to the movement id. In addition, I made a search for the data you want to reach, according to the plate of your sales.
